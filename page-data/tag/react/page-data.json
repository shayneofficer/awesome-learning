But what's the big deal? Why should you care about Hooks? Do you need to refactor all your old code? And why do I see so many people sharing hooks online? This course will introduce engineers to React Hooks, the differences between writing Class Components and Hooked Components, and some common patterns in writing components with Hooks."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/tech-talks/react-boston/using-react-testing-library","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using React Testing Library to Write Stronger Tests","category":null,"description":"If you had to rewrite your tests when writing a hook in your React application, then you’re writing tests wrong.\n\nreact-testing-library is what it sounds like, but more importantly, it encourages writing tests in the way that your end users will be using your components.\n\nIn this talk, I will first introduce react-testing-library, what it is, what it encourages, and what it does best. I’ll then dive into how to effectively test a react component, first a smaller component, then a \"larger\" component with redux, i18n dependencies, etc., then I will show all of the different APIs that react-testing-library provides, and how to effectively use them. Then, I’ll show how to write effective tests across an entire application (writing reusable, effective tests that are not brittle).\n"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"React","currentPage":0,"coursesLimit":10,"coursesOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/react","nextPagePath":"/tag/react/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["784018950"]}
